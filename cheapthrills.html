            Come on, come on, turn the radio on
            It's Friday night, and it won't be long
            Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
            It's Friday night, and it won't be long
            'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
            I got all I need
            No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
            But I got you, baby
            Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
            (I love cheap thrills)
            Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
            (I love cheap thrills)
            But I don't need no money
            As long as I can feel the beat
            I don't need no money
            As long as I keep dancing
            Come on, come on, turn the radio on
            It's Saturday, and it won't be long
            Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
            It's Saturday, and it won't be long
            'Til I hit the dance floor, hit the dance floor
            I got all I need
            No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
            But I got you, baby

            I don't need no money
            As long as I keep dancing
            (Oh, oh, oh)
            Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
