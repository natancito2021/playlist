            If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy <br>
            And I can take you for a ride <br>
            I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm <br>
            Where the music don't stop for life <br>
            Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes <br>
            Shining just the way I like <br>
            If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company <br>
            You met me at the perfect time <br>
            You want me, I want you, baby <br>
            My sugarboo, I'm levitating <br>
            The Milky Way, we're renegading <br>
            Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah <br>

            I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight <br>
            I need you all night, come on, dance with me <br>
            I'm levitating <br>
            You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight) <br>
            I need you all night, come on, dance with me <br>
            I'm levitating<br>
            I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy<br>
            I see us written in the stars<br>
            We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never<br>
            Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far<br>
            Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes<br>
            Shining just the way we are<br>
            I feel like we're forever every time we get together<br>
            But whatever, let's get lost on Mars<br>
            You want me, I want you, baby<br>
            My sugarboo, I'm levitating<br>
            The Milky Way, we're renegading<br>
            Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah<br>

            I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight<br>
            I need you all night, come on, dance with me<br>

            You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)<br>
            I need you all night, come on, dance with me<br>
            I'm levitating<br>
            You can fly away with me tonight<br>
            You can fly away with me tonight<br>
            Baby, let me take you for a ride<br>
            Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah<br>

            Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (woo)<br>
            My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off<br>
            And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off<br>
            And even if I wanted to, I can't stop<br>
