            Ow!
            Who's that sexy thing I see over there?
            That's me, standin' in the mirror
            What's that icy thing hanging 'round my neck?
            Um, that's gold, show me some respect, oh
            I thank God every day (uh, ha)
            That I woke up feelin' this way (uh, ha)
            And I can't help loving myself
            And I don't need nobody else, no, uh
            If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            I walk in like a dime piece
            I go straight to V.I.P.
            I never pay for my drinks
            My entourage behind me
            My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
            So bless me, baby, achoo
            And even if they tried to
            They can't do it like I do
            I thank God every day (uh, ha)
            That I woke up feelin' this way (uh, ha)
            And I can't help lovin' myself (wooh!)
            And I don't need nobody else, no, uh (baby)
            If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too (oh, ayy)
            If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            Ow!
            (Turn the bass up)
            (Hahaha!)
            Turn the bass up
            Ow!
            (Turn the bass up)
            Let's go
            I thank God every day (say to thank God)
            That I woke up feelin' this way (uh, ha)
            And I can't help loving myself (ow!)
            And I don't need nobody else, no, uh, baby
            If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too (oh)
            If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            I'd wanna be me too
            If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
