            Well, sometimes I go out by myself
            And I look across the water
            And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
            And in my head I paint a picture
            'Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
            And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
            Won't you come on over? Stop makin' a fool out of me
            Why don't you come on over Valerie?
            Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
            Did you have to go to jail, put your house all up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
            I hope you didn't catch a tan, I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
            And are you shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of you hair, and are you busy?
            And did you have to pay that fine that you were dodgin' all the time, are you still dizzy?
            'Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
            And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
            Won't you come on over? Stop makin' a fool out of me
            Why don't you come on over Valerie?
            Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
            Well sometimes I go out by myself
            And I look across the water
            And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
            And in my head I paint a picture
            'Cause since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
            And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
            Won't you come on over? Stop makin' a fool out of me
            Why don't you come on over Valerie?
            Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
            Valerie, hey
            Valerie, Valerie
            Valerie, why don't you come on over, Valerie?
